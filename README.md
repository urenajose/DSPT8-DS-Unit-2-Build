Machine Learning model Applied Modeling
Dataset, Model Target
Dataset use for this blog post is from Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes, dataset repository can be found in Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/aaronschlegel/austin-animal-center-shelter-outcomes-and
code for the model: https://github.com/urenajose/DS-Unit-1-Build/blob/master/Unit%202%20build/DS_Unit_2_Build_ACC_Shelter_Dataset_ipyn.ipynb
The Dataset shape is (78244, 22), all the columns are string type, most of the information is categorical, with some columns having date time information.
Use Random Forest, XGB Classefier and Logistic Reggression model
Use Shap and partial dependence plot (PDP) to explain my model.
